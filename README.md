Trained the model with GPU on Google Colab

applied vgg model with 3 layers on cifar dataset

First used vgg with 3 layers without Dropt, model overfit with train accuracy of 100% and test accuracy 73%

vgg with 3 layers with Dropt has fairly good result with  train accuracy of 87% and test accuracy 82%

vgg with 3 layers without Dropt and Data Augmentation has also good result with  train accuracy of 86% and test accuracy 82%
